article:
- Masazo Nonaka, the Japanese man holding the Guinness World Record for longest living male, turned 113 on last Wednesday. He was born in 1905, the same year Albert Einstein published his theory of relativity and Theodore Roosevelt was inaugurated for his second term as the 26th president of the United States.
- Nonaka grew up in Ashoro, a small town on the Japanese island of Hokkaido, with six brothers and one sister. He married in 1931, had five children, and ran an inn for most of his life.
- His secret to longevity? Sweets. It might not be most doctors’ suggestion, but Nonaka says he’s lived such a long life because he soaks in hot springs and eats plenty of sweets. His daughter, however, told Guinness that his long life is due to lack of stress—he lives his life on his own terms. “If he doesn’t want something, he’ll make sure everyone knows about it.”

- 上周三，吉尼斯世界纪录全世界最长寿的日本籍男子 Masazo Nonaka 度过了自己的113岁生日。他出生于1905年，同年，爱因斯坦发表了相对论，罗斯福作为美利坚合众国第26任总统刚刚开始第二任期。
- Nonaka 在日本岛屿Hokkaido 的小镇Ashoro 长大，有6个弟弟和1个妹妹。他在1931年结婚，有五个孩子，大半辈子都以开客栈为生。
- 野中正造的长寿秘诀是什么？是甜食。大部分医生可能不建议吃甜食，但他说自己之所以长寿，就是因为泡温泉和大量吃甜食。不过他女儿对吉尼斯官方表示，他长寿是因为压力小——以自己的方式来生活。“如果他不喜欢一件事，他会让每个人知道。”
