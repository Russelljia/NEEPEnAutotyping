- 'Unfortunately, life is not a bed of roses. /2/ We are going through life facing sad experiences. /3/ Moreover, we are grieving various kinds of loss: a friendship, a romantic relationship or a house. /4/ Hard times may hold you down at what usually seems like the most inopportune time, but you should remember that they won’t last forever.'
- When our time of mourning is over, we press forward, stronger with a greater understanding and respect for life. /2/ Furthermore, these losses make us mature and eventually move us toward future opportunities for growth and happiness. /3/ I want to share these old truths I’ve learned along the way.
- '##Most of your fears are unreal'
- Fear is both useful and harmful. /2/ This normal human reaction is used to protect us by signaling danger and preparing us to deal with it. /3/ Unfortunately, people create inner barriers with a help of exaggerating fears. /4/ My favorite actor Will Smith once said, “Fear is not real. /5/ It is a product of thoughts you create. /6/ Do not misunderstand me. /7/ Danger is very real. /8/ But fear is a choice.” /9/ I do completely agree that fears are just the product of our luxuriant imagination.
- '##Think about the present moment'
- If you are surrounded by problems and cannot stop thinking about the past, try to focus on the present moment. /2/ Many of us are weighed down by the past or anxious about the future. /3/ You may feel guilt over your past, but you are poisoning the present with the things and circumstances you cannot change. /4/ Value the present moment and remember how fortunate you are to be alive. /5/ Enjoy the beauty of the world around and keep the eyes open to see the possibilities before you. /6/ Happiness is not a point of future and not a moment from the past, but a mindset that can be designed into the present.
- '##There are many things to be grateful for'
- Sometimes it is easy to feel bad because you are going through tough times. /2/ You can be easily caught up by life problems that you forget to pause and appreciate the things you have. /3/ Only strong people prefer to smile and value their life instead of crying and complaining about something.
- '##You are not alone'
- No matter how isolated you might feel and how serious the situation is, you should always remember that you are not alone. /2/ Try to keep in mind that almost everyone respects and wants to help you if you are trying to make a good change in your life, especially your dearest and nearest people. /3/ You may have a circle of friends who provide constant good humor, help and companionship. /4/ If you have no friends or relatives, try to participate in several online communities, full of people who are always willing to share advice and encouragement.
- '##Pave your own unique path'
- Today many people find it difficult to trust their own opinion and seek balance by gaining objectivity from external sources. /2/ This way you devalue your opinion and show that you are incapable of managing your own life. /3/ When you are struggling to achieve something important you should believe in yourself and be sure that your decision is the best. /4/ You live in your skin, think your own thoughts, have your own values and make your own choices.

intpts:
-   - 阅读分析第三段可知fear为本段出现频率最高的关键词。再根据第四句：Fear is not real,第五句：It is a product of thoughts you create,第八句：I do completely agree that fears are just the product of our luxuriant imagination,可知本段的主旨和D选项：Most of your fears are unreal不谋而合，因此，答案为D选项。
    - 干扰项的解释，若没有则留空。
-   - 阅读分析第四段第一句话（If you are surrounded by problems and cannot stop thinking about the past, try to focus on the present moment）可知作者的建议是focus on the present moment（关注当下）。然后，第四句话（Value the present moment and remember how fortunate you are to be alive）以及最后一句话（Happiness is not a point of future and not a moment from the past, but a mindset that can be designed into the present）再次体现了作者的这一建议，可见本段的主旨为关注当下。因此E选项（Think about the present moment）为正确选项。
    - B选项（Experience helps you grow）根据该段中的Many of us are weighed down by the past以及You may feel guilt over your past设置干扰，但是该段的主题为present而非experience。该选项属于以偏概全。
-   - 阅读分析第五段第二句话可知，人们很容易被生活中所遭遇的麻烦而忘记欣赏自己所拥有的东西。第三句话指出：坚强的人会珍惜他们的生活而不是一味的抱怨。因此可知G选项（ There are many things to be grateful for）为本段主旨。其中，appreciate，value，instead of crying and complaining是be grateful的同义替换。
    - ''
-   - 阅读分析第六段第一句话可知该段的主旨为you should always remember that you are not alone（你要永远记得你并不孤独），因此A选项（You are not alone）为正确选项。
    - ''
-   - 阅读分析第七段可知，最后一句话（You live in your skin, think your own thoughts, have your own values and make your own choices）体现了本段主旨。C选项（Pave your own unique path）是think your own thoughts, have your own values and make your own choices的同义替换。
    - F选项（Don’t fear responsibility for your life）根据该段中的Today many people find it difficult to trust their own opinion，you are incapable of managing your own life设置干扰，但是responsibility并非本段主旨，该选项属于以偏概全。
