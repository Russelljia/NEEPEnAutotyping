## 1. My dream has always been to work somewhere in an area between fashion and publishing.
[trans] 我一直梦想在时装设计与出版相关的领域工作。
[wd-meaning] fashion 的常用义项为时尚，但另有义项为时装领域，这里可以译为时装设计领域。
[wd-add]
[wd-cut] somewhere 不易译出，省去不改变文意。
[wd-convert] dream 名词梦想，这里译作动词；work 为动词工作，上文译为动词，亦可以译为名词，“我一直梦想在……领域找一份工作。”

[st-adjust]
[st-covert]
[st-split]
[st-combine]

## 2. Two years before graduating from secondary school, I took a sewing and design course thinking that I would move on to a fashion design course.
[trans] 中学毕业前两年，我选修了一门缝纫与设计的课，以为自己接着会去上服装设计的课。
[wd-meaning] secondary school, 中学；took 选择，这里译作选修；thinking, 想象，这里译作以为。
[wd-add]
[wd-cut] 这里的第二个冠词 a 可以省略
[wd-convert]

[st-adjust]
[st-covert]
[st-split] thinking...以后为状语从句，这里译为分句。
[st-combine]

## 3. However, during that course I realized I was not good enough in this area to compete with other creative personalities in the future, so I decided that it was not the right path for me.
[trans] 然而，在上这门课时，我发现在未来我并没有足够能力在这一领域与其他有创造性的人相竞争，因此这并不是适合我的职业路径。
[wd-meaning] personalities 意为性格特点，这里译为人；good enough 译为“有足够能力”。
[wd-add]
[wd-cut] I decided 不可以译作“我决定”，这里作省略处理。
[wd-convert] the right path for me, 这里介词 for 译作动词“适合” 。

[st-adjust] in the future 时间状语提前；with other creative personalities 状语提前。
[st-covert] I decided that 之后的宾语从句译为主句。
[st-split]
[st-combine]


## 4. Before applying for university I told everyone that I would study journalism, because writing was, and still is, one of my favorite activities.
[trans] 因为写作一直以来是我最喜欢的事之一，所以在申请大学前我告诉每个人我会学习新闻专业。
[wd-meaning] journalism 意为新闻业，这里作为学校的专业，译作新闻专业；activities 活动，这里翻译成“事”。
[wd-add] 因为调整了语序，所以后半句增译“所以”；writing was, and still is... 为表达时态可增译“以前……，现在……”，或者增译为“一直以来”。
[wd-cut]
[wd-convert] favorite 形容词，翻译为动词“喜欢”。

[st-adjust] because ... 原因状语提前。
[st-covert]
[st-split]
[st-combine]



## 5. But, to be honest, I said it, because I thought that fashion and me together was just a dream—I knew that no one could imagine me in the fashion industry at all!
[trans] 但老实说，我之所以这样说，是因为我觉得时装设计对我只是一个梦——根本没人相信我能从事时尚行业！
[wd-meaning] imagine 想象，这里译作“相信”。
[wd-add] to be honest, 增译“说”；I said it, 增译“之所以”。
[wd-cut] I knew that 省略。
[wd-convert] in the fashion industry 中 in 介词译为动词“从事”；

[st-adjust] at all 程度状语，译作“根本”提前；
[st-covert] fashion and me together, me 与 fashion 并列作主语，译文中“我”作介词“对”的宾语。
[st-split]
[st-combine]

## 6. So I decided to look for some fashion-related courses that included writing.
[trans] 我于是决定寻找包含写作内容的时装相关课程。
[wd-meaning]
[wd-add]
[wd-cut]
[wd-convert]

[st-adjust]
[st-covert] 定语从句 that included writing 译为定语并提前。
[st-split]
[st-combine]

## 7. This is when I noticed the course “Fashion Media & Promotion.”
[trans] 这时我看到了“时尚媒体与营销”这门课。
[wd-meaning] noticed 注意，译为“看到了”。
[wd-add]
[wd-cut]
[wd-convert]

[st-adjust] "Fashion Media & Promotion" 作同位语，译文提到中心词之前。
[st-covert] is 后的表语从句译作主句。
[st-split]
[st-combine]
