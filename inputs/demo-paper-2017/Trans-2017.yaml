- My dream has always been to work somewhere in an area between fashion and publishing. /2/ Two years before graduating from secondary school, I took a sewing and design course thinking that I would move on to a fashion design course. /3/ However, during that course I realised I was not good enough in this area to compete with other creative personalities in the future, so I decided that it was not the right path for me. /4/ Before applying for university I told everyone that I would study journalism, because writing was, and still is, one of my favourite activities. /5/ But, to be honest, I said it, because I thought that fashion and me together was just a dream – I knew that no one could imagine me in the fashion industry at all! /6/ So I decided to look for some fashion-related courses that included writing. /7/ This is when I noticed the course “Fashion Media & Promotion.”

- 我一直梦想在时装设计与出版相关的领域工作。/2/ 中学毕业前两年，我选修了一门缝纫与设计的课，以为自己接着会去上服装设计的课。/3/ 然而，在上这门课时，我发现在未来我并没有足够能力在这一领域与其他有创造性的人相竞争，因此这并不是适合我的职业路径。/4/ 因为写作一直以来是我最喜欢的事之一，所以在申请大学前我告诉每个人我会学习新闻专业。/5/ 但老实说，我之所以这样说，是因为我觉得时装设计对我只是一个梦——根本没人相信我能从事时尚行业！/6/ 我于是决定寻找包含写作内容的时装相关课程。/7/ 这时我看到了“时尚媒体与营销”这门课。
