- Dear Jack,
- I'm so excited to hear that you will come to Beijing next week. This is a great chance for me to express my sincere gratitude for your support and assistance when I worked in America. That's really very kind of you.
- You mentioned that you would stay in Beijing for one month in your letter. I'm writing to ask if you would mind my taking you around. There are lots of places which really deserve to be visited, such as the Great Wall, the Forbidden City, and the Temple of Heaven, to name just a few. I strongly believe that you will have a great time here.

- It can be seen clearly from the bar chart that the number of students both receiving postgraduate and studing aboard has been on a rise. To be more specific, those folks who choose to accept postgraduate surged from 1.1 million in the year of 2005 to 1.9 million in the year of 2015, while those people who study overseas ascended from 130 thousand in 2005 to 520 thousand in 2015.
- As we all know, everything happens for a reason. the three subsequent ones, from my way of thinkinng, are worth mentioning. To begin with, as the pace of social development accelerates, one getting a higher degree can keep up with the tempo. Furthermore, another equally element to be mentioned is that the higher diploma one gets, the more likely he/she can gain an upper hand in the future cut-throat competition. Finally, the reason why more people tend to study overseas is that there will be a mass of opportunities to broaden their horizon and increase their knowledge in many aspects.
- As has been analyzed above, from my own perspective, education, whatever form it takes, should be encouraged, supported and advocated. For both our country and students can benefit from this trend. The folks who accept high educaton can avoid being ignorant. The well-educated citizens can make our country wealthy and powerful.

e_translation:
- 从柱状图中我们可以清晰的看出：接受研究生教育和出国留学的人数都在增长。具体的说，接受研究生教育的人数从2005年的110万增长到2015年的190万，出国留学的人数从2005年的13万增长到2015年的52万。
- 众所周知，万物皆有因。依我看来，以下三个因素值得一提。首先，随着社会发展速度加快，学历更高的人才能赶上这种发展节奏。其次，另外一个值得一提的因素就是：一个人的学历越高，就越可能在未来激烈的竞争中脱颖而出。最后，关于许多人选择出国留学的原因即为：他们能获得大量的机会来拓展个人视野，以及从各方面增长知识。
- 综上所述，在我看来，无论什么形式的教育都应被鼓励，支持，提倡。因为国家和个人都能从这种趋势中受益。接受高等教育的个人能避免无知，受过良好教育的公民能使国家富强。
